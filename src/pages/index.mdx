# The Community Archive
---

<center>[Archive Map](/collections)</center>

## Why
Digital storage for archives is a long term, and in some cases permanent, committment. 

Archives pay monthly or yearly installments to store their data in the cloud.

As collections grow more overtime, these fees increase...

Grant money being inconsistent and inadequate, the cloud storage bill one day can't be justified.
      
The public loses access to knowledge and the archive loses a service to which life was devoted.

## Proposal
A musuem or archive may use a grant to build a display, 
that if maintined properly, could last a lifetime and more.

Digital storage, on the other hand, requires a consistent and growing cash flow. 

A grant dedicated to storage only grants the storage of a set ammount of gb per time. 

And grants arent increasing. 

This archive will store data *permanently*[^1].

The community wallet shows how much data we can store. 

The activities page shows all:
1. Requests for storage from community wallet
2. Removals and updates
3. All updates to code
4. General governance

In effect I have created a transparent archive that can rely on inconsistent funds to store data long term for the public. 

[^1]: So long the Arweave network persists. They estimate 200 years.
      It could be forked by another project later.
      Though do not let this distract you from the possibilities presented by this project.
