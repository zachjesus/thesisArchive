# Open Archive

A way for you to quickly create an archive for your ArDrive Turbo Uploads. What you upload will be permanent and remain for long as the Arweave network exists for a one time fee. 

ArDrive turbo uploads can easily be scripted in bulk with a scripting language and the ArDrive CLI. 

Make sure you add metadata to your uploads!
